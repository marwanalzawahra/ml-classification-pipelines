# ML Classification Pipelines

End-to-end machine learning classification pipelines implemented in Python using scikit-learn.
This repository focuses on clean preprocessing, reproducible workflows, and clear model evaluation.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to build complete classification pipelines, starting from raw data and ending with properly evaluated models.
The focus is on correct machine learning methodology rather than heavy optimization.
